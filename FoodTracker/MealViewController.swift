Name, photo, rating. [0, 0, 0]. Typically, stack navigation involves non-editable detail displays though, and editing is accomplished through an edit mode. While I'll go for this pattern in future apps, I can't be assed messing with too much at the moment... nah maybe I should just do that? That would involve making a mealDisplayViewController corresponding to a non-interactive mealDisplayView, that has an edit button.
